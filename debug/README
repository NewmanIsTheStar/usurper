The two bash scripts in this directory are used for step through debugging with gdb using the pico debug probe. It is usually best to run these in two separate terminal windows so that you can easily see what is going on.  Run these scripts prior to starting VSCode.

debugserver - establish connection via pico probe, this shows you what gdb is doing during a debug session
watchlog    - display stdout from the pi pico, this shows you any printf output from your program

To start step through debugging in VSCode, first click on the "Run and Debug" icon on the left side of the window, then click on the green triangle icon to start the program.  The first time you do this you might get a drop down list of options, choose "launch.json"

NOTES
1. Under no circumstances should you click on "Import Project" if using the VSCode Pi Pico Extension -- this will entirely screw up the project.
2. If you build the code using make from the command line, then it will fail to build from within VSCode until you remove the remnants of the previous build from the build directory:
    rm CMakeCache.txt 
    rm -rf CMakeFiles/
